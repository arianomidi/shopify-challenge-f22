<h1 align="center">Welcome to shopify-challenge-f22 ðŸ‘‹</h1>

> I made this web application for the Fall 2022 Shopify Developer Intern Challenge. We were tasked to develop an inventory tracking application for a logistics company with CRUD functionality. The inventory is populated with some of my favourite piano repertoire. Feel free to add your favourite songs as well! Thanks for your time and consideration.
